#  MYTHS

- High reps != More defined Muscles
	For Defination you need to decrease the fat % by going on a cutting diet

>[!Important]- For bulking and cutting you need a maximum of  0.82g/lb protein per body weight i.e 1.8 g per kg therefore for 75 kg its around 135 g of protein 
- For loosing Fat prioritize Strength training over Cardio
- You can't Spot reduce Fat because body burns fats systematically

# Mistakes that Ruin Results

- Have specific and Timely goals
- PLAN: when and where and how you will be working out
- Always not warming up
	- do that by running one round of 2.2

# TIPS

- 45mins- 1hr is enough to get incredible results
- Feel your Muscle stretch i.e Mind Body Connection
- After Failure try to do Partial reps till Failure, increases muscle growth more
- Warm up by doing 3 warm up sets
		1st set of 15 easy reps
		2nd set of 10 normal sets
		3rd set of 8 medium reps
		normal sets of 4-8 reps

- Every 2 Months take a 1 week off for Recovery
- Keep a notebook to track your Strength and Nutrition 
- Do a lot of Body **Weight and Compound** Excercises

- 2:1:2:1 2 seconds up, 2 seconds down,1 second at top/bottom
	- breathe out at the difficult part
	- breathe in at the easy part
	- Stay in Control Always

- Fail within 4-8 rep range
- Always rep till failure, so up the weight if rep count increases
- Be aware of hidden calories like Jam/Butter/oil

Eat low Glycemic Index Foods
![[Pasted image 20241205155825.png]]

My BMR for 75 kgs is 1820 Calories/day 
For Sedentary lifestyle I need 2300 calories
but if I plan to work out it should be Total Daily Expenditure (TDE) = 2800 i.e 1000 cal more than BMR
For Bulking add 500-100 more calories
For Cutting Subtract 500-750 calories 

# Creatine
Can be used and most heavily researched
Boosts Strength, power and Endurance
You have to take it daily to build the creatine reserves in Muscles, its like Finasteride
Eating once every few days wont help
