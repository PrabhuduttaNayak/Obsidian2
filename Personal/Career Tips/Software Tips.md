#### `How to get hired as a Junior DEV`?

	If you're out there job hunting or thinking about entering this industry, you've got to build a compelling case for yourself. It's not one of "wow look at all these bullet points on my resume" because your current knowledge isn't going to get you very far. The story you have to tell is "here's where I am and where I'm headed on my growth curve." This is how I push myself. This is how I get better. This is what I do when I don't know what to do. This is how I collaborate, give, and get feedback 
	That's what's missing when the advice around here is to crush Leetcodes until your eyes bleed. Your technical skills today are important, but they're not good enough to win you a job. You've got to show that you're going somewhere, you're becoming someone, and that person will be incredibly valuable.
